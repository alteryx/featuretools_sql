# featuretools-sql 
The `featuretools-sql` library allows users to directly import and convert their relational data into a 
[Featuretools](https://github.com/Featuretools/featuretools) compatible format. 

## Installation 
TODO 

## Connecting your database to `featuretools-sql` 
Simply pass in the database connection information. For example:

```python
from connector import DBConnector

config = dict()
config["system_name"] = "mysql"
config["host"] = "127.0.0.1:3306"
config["password"] = "password"
config["user"] = "root"
config["database"] = "db"

sql_connector = DBConnector(**config) 
entity_set = sql_connector.get_entity_set()
```

The relational data is now a `featuretools.EntitySet` object, ready for feature engineering.

`featuretools-sql` currently supports importing data from the following database management systems: 
  - `MySQL`
