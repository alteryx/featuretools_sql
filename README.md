<i>Seamlessly integrate SQL data with Featuretools</i>
</p>

# featuretools_sql 
The `featuretools_sql` library allows users to directly import and convert their relational data into a 
[Featuretools](https://github.com/Featuretools/featuretools) compatible format. 

## Installation 
### `featuretools_sql` can be installed with `pip` or `conda`
### Install with `pip` 
`python -m pip install featuretools[sql]`
### Or from the `Conda-forge` channel on [conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/featuretools) 
conda install -c conda-forge featuretools featuretools_sql

## Connecting your database to `featuretools_sql` 
Simply pass in the database connection information. For example:

```python
from connector import DBConnector
import featuretools as ft 

config = dict()
config["system_name"] = "mysql"
config["host"] = "127.0.0.1:3306"
config["password"] = "password"
config["user"] = "root"
config["database"] = "db"

sql_connector = DBConnector(**config) 
entity_set = sql_connector.get_entity_set()

# The entity_set object will have the `relationships` and `dataframes` 
# data structures already populated as member data.

# This means that you are ready to call DFS!
feature_defs, feature_matrix = ft.dfs(dataframes=entity_set.dataframes, relationships=entity_set.relationships)

# If you'd rather inspect the data structures first, you can do that too. 
dataframes = entity_set.dataframes 
relationships = entity_set.relationships 
```

`featuretools_sql` currently supports importing data from the following database management systems: 
  - `MySQL` 
  - `Postgres`
